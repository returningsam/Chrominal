# Chrominal

A new tab replacement that provides a unix-like experience for bookmark management and quick search functionality, along with some extra features.



## Current Features:

### Promt:

As in your unix terminal, a prompt will be displayed in the format:

```chrome@username:current_directory$```

### Search:

These commands allow you to open a search page using Google, YouTube, Bing, Wolfram Alpha, and DuckDuckGo, all from your new tab page.

```
$ search [keyword...]
$ s [keyword...]
$ google [keyword...]
$ youtube [keyword...]
$ duck [keyword...]
$ duckduckgo [keyword...]
$ bing [keyword...]
$ wolf [keyword...]
$ wolframalpha [keyword...]
```

### Navigation:

Navigate your bookmarks tree in chrome as if you were navigating your file tree using a unix terminal.

```
$ mv [-k] source destination [index]
    -k :: will keep the index of the source the same after renaming or moving the source.
    [index] :: the new index after renaming or moving the source.
```

### Modification:

Edit your bookmarks and bookmarks tree by moving and renaming your bookmarks the same way you would in a unix environment.
